    "## Can \"experience\" predict \"played hours\" in players.csv?\n",
    "Using linear regression, the experience variable is first converted into an numeric scale (for example, Beginner = 0, Amateur = 1, Regular = 2, Veteran = 3, Pro = 4) so that its progression can be interpreted mathematically. This experience value is then used as the X value in the regression model, while future played hours serves as the Y value. The regression algorithm fits a line of best fit through the data points by estimating coefficients that describe the relationship between experience and playtime. In order to wrangle a text file with these values, the first step is to read the csv and remove all the unneeded fields. The only fields to be kept are exclusively experience and played hours. Next, experience has to be converted into a numeric scale, assigning numbers to each predetermined string. Lastly, to prevent extreme skew, it might be needed to perform a log transform on the number of hours played. "

    "## Notes\n",
    "A problem that has occured in the graph is the large amount of individuals who have logged 0 total hours played on the server. Originally I wanted to include them but it occured to me since this data is supposed to corrolate to players who play on the server, individuals who have not logged any time are considered not eligible for consideration and have hence been removed as an outlier. Otherwise they would skew the results by a large margin regardless of skill level (not actually being part of the study). They haven't even logged on! As the canvas says to only wrangle the bare minimum, I have opted to keep them here for now."

    "### Why is linear regression appropriate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is appropriate when you want to **predict a continuous outcome** (`played_hours`) from one or more predictors (`experience_num`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here, `played_hours` is continuous (numeric), and we’ve converted `experience` to a numeric scale (0–4).\n",
    "* Linear regression will estimate a **linear relationship**, i.e., it assumes that as experience increases, the expected played hours change in a linear fashion.\n",
    "* It’s simple, interpretable, and widely used for exploratory analysis of relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Assumptions required for linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard assumptions for **ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linearity:** The relationship between `experience_num` and `played_hours` is linear.\n",
    "2. **Independence:** Each observation (player) is independent of the others.\n",
    "3. **Homoscedasticity:** The residuals (differences between predicted and actual `played_hours`) have constant variance across all levels of `experience_num`.\n",
    "4. **Normality of residuals:** The residuals are approximately normally distributed (important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals).\n",
    "5. **No perfect multicollinearity:** Not an issue here since we have only **one predictor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Potential limitations or weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linearity assumption may not hold:** Experience may not have a strictly linear effect on played hours. Maybe beginners and pros play more, while intermediates play less → relationship could be nonlinear.\n",
    "* **Outliers:** Extreme values in `played_hours` can heavily influence the regression.\n",
    "* **Skewed data:** If many players have zero hours, residuals may not be normally distributed.\n",
    "* **Single predictor limitation:** Only using experience ignores other potentially important factors (age, gender, subscription, etc.).\n",
    "* **Causality:** Regression only captures association, not causation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️⃣ How to compare and select the model\n",
    "\n",
    "* **R² (coefficient of determination):** Measures how much variation in `played_hours` is explained by `experience_num`.\n",
    "* **Adjusted R²:** Adjusts for multiple predictors if you add more later.\n",
    "* **Residual plots:** Check for nonlinearity, heteroscedasticity, or patterns.\n",
    "* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Measures predictive accuracy.\n",
    "* **Cross-validation:** Use k-fold CV to estimate out-of-sample performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If multiple models are tested (e.g., linear vs polynomial), compare R², RMSE, or cross-validated RMSE to pick the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to process the data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Clean the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert `experience` → `experience_num`.\n",
    "* Deal with outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Split the data**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Common approach: **train-test split**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Example: 70% train, 30% test.\n",
    "  * Randomly sample rows.\n",
    "* Optionally, create a **validation set** or use **k-fold cross-validation** (e.g., k = 5 or 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Apply linear regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fit the model on the training set.\n",
    "* Evaluate performance on the test set (or using cross-validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Optional transformations**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If residuals are skewed or variance is unequal, consider **log-transforming `played_hours`**."
