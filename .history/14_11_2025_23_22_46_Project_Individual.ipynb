    "## Can \"experience\" predict \"played hours\" in players.csv?\n",
    "Using linear regression, the experience variable is first converted into an numeric scale (for example, Beginner = 0, Amateur = 1, Regular = 2, Veteran = 3, Pro = 4) so that its progression can be interpreted mathematically. This experience value is then used as the X value in the regression model, while future played hours serves as the Y value. The regression algorithm fits a line of best fit through the data points by estimating coefficients that describe the relationship between experience and playtime. In order to wrangle a text file with these values, the first step is to read the csv and remove all the unneeded fields. The only fields to be kept are exclusively experience and played hours. Next, experience has to be converted into a numeric scale, assigning numbers to each predetermined string. Lastly, to prevent extreme skew, it might be needed to perform a log transform on the number of hours played. "
